function G = vertcat(varargin)
% G = vertcat(E,F) performs the vertical concatenation operation [E; F]
% 
% INPUTS:
% E,F: dpvar, polynomial, or double objects (at least one is a dpvar object)
%       - Must have the same number of columns
%       - polynomials will be converted to dpvars using poly2dpvar
%       - doubles will be converted to constant dpvars
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% G: dpvar object
%       - G = [E; F]
